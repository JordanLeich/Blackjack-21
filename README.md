# Description :black_joker:
- This is a game where you play against the dealer and try to get the higher values of cards without exceeding over the number 21. If your cards ever equal a total of 21, you automatically get blackjack (win) unless both you and the dealer get 21 then you push (tie). The user also has a cash balance that is wagered based on winning or losing, the user must keep their cash balance positive and not negative to keep playing.
